RecipeShare - Full project (server + client)

Quick start:
1) Server:
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   -> Server runs on http://localhost:4000

2) Client (development):
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   -> Client runs on http://localhost:3000 and proxies API to /api (server).

Or build client and serve from server:
   cd client
   npm run build
   cd ../server
   npm start

Notes:
- Uses SQLite database stored at server/recipeshare.db
- Images uploaded are stored in server/uploads/
- Default JWT secret is in server.js; change in production.
- This is a lightweight, single-developer starter project. Improve validations/security before production.

Files included:
- server/: Express backend, endpoints per spec (recipes, comments, ratings, favorites, auth)
- client/: React frontend (Create, view, comment, rate, favorite)
